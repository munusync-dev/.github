## Hiring is Chaos.

**Munusync Brings Order.**

**Example:**

- A recruiter posts a job.
- 500+ applications flood in.
- Hours are lost sorting, filtering, guessing.
- Best-fit candidate? Likely gave up halfway.

Meanwhile…

- A developer applies to 20 jobs.
- No reply. No feedback. No idea what went wrong.
